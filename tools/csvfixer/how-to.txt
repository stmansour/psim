HOW TO USE csvfixer
===================

The purpose of csvfixer is to reformat column data which is provided at intervals 
greater than 1 day and produce a file with values for every day.  The first column
must be labeled "Date" and the remaining columns can be any numerical data columns
you wish.  The date (in the examples below: Jan 2, 2006) must be in one of these
formats:

	2006-1-2
	1/2/06
	1/2/2006

The program reads Line 1 of the file, which must contain the column headers 
and "Date" must be the first column. It reads the next line (Line 2), makes note
of the date value, then echos its contents to the output. It reads the next line
Line 3, and looks at the date. If the
date is 1 day past the date on Line 1, then it will echo these values to the
output. If the date is more than 1 day past the date of Line 1 it will output a
line for each day after Line 1's date up to 1 day prior to the date in Line 2.
The values in the other columns will be the same as the values on Line 1.

For example, assume that the first 3 lines of the file it reads are the following:

    Date,Value1,Value2
    1/1/2023, 0.5, 750
    1/5/2023, 0.7, 399

The output of the program will be:

    Date,Value1,Value2
    1/1/2023, 0.5, 750
    1/2/2023, 0.5, 750
    1/3/2023, 0.5, 750
    1/4/2023, 0.5, 750
    1/5/2023, 0.7, 399

USAGE
=====

1. Simplest form of usage:  read the input and send the output to the terminal:
