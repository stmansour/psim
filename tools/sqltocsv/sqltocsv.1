.TH SQLTOCSV 1 "June 2024" "Version 1.0"
.SH NAME
sqltocsv \- create a set of CSV files to use as a database for \fBsimulator(1)\fP

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sqltocsv

.SH DESCRIPTION
This program creates a CSV file set that can be used as a database by the \fBsimulator(1)\fP. 
The plato simulator runs nearly 100X faster using a CSV file set as a database
rather than the MySQL plato database. The CSV data is loaded into memory and operates
more like an in-program cache than a database. The simulator does not need to write data to
the database. It only reads data, so as long as the CSV files contain the data needed for
the two currencies and the date range used in the simulator, the CSV database is, by far,
the best choice for use in simulations.

Before using this program make sure that config.json5 is in your current directory.
\fBsqltocsv\fP uses the information in the config file to determine the currencies for which
the CSV fileset will be created. The MySQL database can have metric data
for many currencies. The metric data file produced by this process will only
contain the data needed for the two currencies identified in the config file.
