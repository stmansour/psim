We’re designing a system to help us predict when to buy and sell currencies.
We want to develop a prediction engine that can look at different types of historical
data and current events and from that make a prediction about when we should buy or
sell a currency.  In order to see how well our predictive engine works, we want to
develop a simulator that has access to historical data and we can try our predictive
engine using historical data to see how it does.  The predictive engine will be based
on two major object types: an Investor and an Influencer.  The first object type is
an influencer. Influencer is a base class from which many other classes will be
derived.  Two examples of Influencers are: DiscountRate and Unemployment.
These influencer subclasses will examine a specific datum. Its prediction method
must be called with a date for which it makes a prediction regarding a particular
currency. The prediction is one of 3 actions:  "Buy", "Hold", or "Sell".
Along with the predicted action, it returns a probability between 0 and 1 that
represents how certain it is of its prediction.  Each derived Influencer class will
have its own internal variables that must be tuned to provide the most accurate
predictions. Many tests will need to be performed with
different values for these internal variables to determine the values that maximize the
accuracy of its predictions. The second object type is an Investor, which buys and
sells a particular currency type.  Its purpose is to make as much money as possible.
To do this,
it will have a collection of one or more Influencers. Given a particular date, an
Investor will ask its Influencers for a prediction, then it will do its own weighting
on the predictions they make and decide whether it will (a) Buy a currency and how much
it will buy, or (b) Sell a currency and decide how much it will sell, or (c) hold 
the currency that it has. It will develop its own strategy on whether to buy, hold,
or sell a currency based on its Influencers predictions. Investors also have internal variables
that can be adjusted to affect its decisions on when to buy, hold, and sell. Each
Investor will have one or more Influencers as well as other variables whose values
affect how well it performs at making more money. Thus, a unique Investor is defined
by its Influencers and the variable values of 
itself and its influencers.  This makes it possible to have an almost infinite number of
unique Investors. We will need to try many unique Investors to determine what Influencers
and variable values result in making the most money. We want to build a simulation program
to test as many unique
investors as we can to find the best ones. The success of a unique Investor is
determined by how well its predictions lead to profitable currency trading.  That
is, as currencies are bought and sold using its predictions, the Investors that
generate the most profit in trading currencies are considered to be the best.  If
an Investor’s prediction generate a loss, it is considered a bad Investor. Since
the number of combinations of different Investors is, for all practical purposes,
infinite, we want to use a Genetic algorithm to find the best ones. We would run
simulations cycles and successive generations that hopefully become better and
better investors. I would like you to help me design this simulator.
